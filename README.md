<b> An elegant solution for annotation in Google Sheets.</b>
<h2>Annotation Workflow ‚úèÔ∏è</h2>
<b>To get started annotating in Parrot, follow these steps:</b>
<ol>
<li>Open the link and start your queue by clicking the <code>START</code> button.</li>
<li>Follow the task instructions, using the instructions button if you need a refresher. Hover over the section labels to display a tooltip with some basic instructions on that section.</li>
<li>If you feel you cannot complete a task, click the <code>SKIP</code> button in the footer towards the right side.</li>
<li>Once you have completed the task, click the green <code>SUBMIT</code> button in the bottom right corner. If you have missed a mandatory section, you will get a pop up explaining what you missed and the section will be highlighted red.</li>
</ol>
<b> Repeat steps 2 through 4 until you see a message stating that your queue is finished.</b>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>If you made a mistake and would like to edit one of your previous responses, follow these steps:</b>
<ol>
<li>Click the home icon in the bottom left to return to the home page.</li>
<li>Click the <code>BROWSE</code> button to view a list of completed tasks.</li>
<li>Find the row you want to edit <i>(HINT: you can search for an email or name to find it faster, and click on any row to preview its prompt)</i> and click on the <code>rowID</code>, highlighted blue.
<li>Make the necessary edits to your task, and click the <code>SAVE</code> button.</li>
</ol>
<h2>QA Workflow üîç</h2>
<b>To QA annotator completions, follow these steps:</b>
<ol>
<li>Open the link and click the <code>BROWSE</code> button to open the QA menu.</li>
<li>Find the row you want to QA, rows that have not been QAed yet are marked with an exclamation point icon, otherwise they show the email of the annotator who has QAed the row.</li>
<li>Optionally, search for an annotator name and use the prompt previews visible by clicking on a row in the table.</li>
<li>Click the <code>rowID</code>, highlighted in blue, to access the QA editor. Make any needed edits and leave relevant feedback.</li>
<li>If you would just like to edit the task and not send it back to the original annotator, click the <code>SAVE</code> button. Otherwise, click the <code>SEND BACK</code> button.
</ol>
<b>Repeat steps 2 through 5 until you are finished QAing.</b>
