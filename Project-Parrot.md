<b> An elegant solution for annotation in Google Sheets.</b> test14
<h2>Annotation Workflow ‚úèÔ∏è</h2>
<b>To get started annotating in Parrot, follow these steps:</b>
<ol>
<li>Open the link and start your queue by clicking the <code>START</code> button.</li>
<li>Follow the task instructions, using the instructions button if you need a refresher. Hover over the section labels to display a tooltip with some basic instructions on that section.</li>

> *(Tip: The purple rewind button allows you to see the original text of a column, including special markdown characters.)*
<li>If you feel you cannot complete a task, click the <code>SKIP</code> button in the footer towards the right side.</li>
<li>Once you have completed the task, click the green <code>SUBMIT</code> button in the bottom right corner. If you have missed a mandatory section, you will get a pop-up explaining what you missed and the section will be highlighted in red.</li>
</ol>
<b> Repeat steps 2 through 4 until you see a message stating that your queue is finished.</b>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>If you made a mistake and would like to edit one of your previous responses, follow these steps:</b>
<ol>
<li>Click the home icon in the bottom left to return to the home page.</li>
<li>Click the <code>BROWSE</code> button to view a list of completed tasks.</li>
<li>Find the row you want to edit and click on the <code>rowID</code>, highlighted blue.

> <i>(Tip: you can search for your email or name to find it faster, and click on any row to preview its prompt)</i>
</li>
<li>Make the necessary edits to your task, and click the <code>SAVE</code> button.</li>

> *If you click the* `SEND BACK` *button the task will be reinserted at the top of your queue*
</ol>

<h2>QA Workflow üîç</h2>
<b>To QA annotator completions, follow these steps:</b>
<ol>
<li>Open the link and click the <code>BROWSE</code> button to open the QA menu.</li>
<li>Find the row you want to QA, rows that have not been QAed yet are marked with an exclamation point icon, otherwise they show the email of the annotator who has QAed the row.</li>
<li>Optionally, search for an annotator name and use the prompt previews visible by clicking on a row in the table.</li>
<li>Click the <code>rowID</code>, highlighted in blue, to access the QA editor. Make any needed edits and leave relevant feedback in the QA comments box.</li>
<li>If you would just like to edit the task and not send it back to the original annotator, click the <code>SAVE</code> button. Otherwise, click the <code>SEND BACK</code> button.

> *Clicking* `SEND BACK` *will remove the task from the browse list until it is completed by the annotator again*
</ol>
<b>Repeat steps 2 through 5 until you are finished QAing.</b>
<h2>Setting up the Interface ‚öôÔ∏è</h2>

<b>To set up a project using Parrot begin with these steps:</b>

> [!NOTE]  
> Attempting to use the Setup Dashboard from a browser signed into multiple Google accounts **may** cause issues for some users when trying to submit a configuration. The error will result in the user being stuck on a loading screen after pressing the <code>Configure</code> button. If this occurs, the recommended path of action is to try submitting the configuration from an Incognito/Private tab where all other accounts are signed out by default. If the issue persists please contact a project maintainer.  

<ol>
<li>Create a copy of the Parrot Template spreadsheet provided by a project maintainer by going to the <code>File</code> dropdown and clicking <code>Make a copy</code>.</li>
<li>Copy and paste the entirety of your main task spreadsheet into the <code>data</code> tab of the copied template. The <code>data</code> tab should now contain all of the information needed to carry out the task. This will differ depending on the task at hand but an example would be the <code>data</code> tab containing individual columns for prompts, responses, empty columns for completions, etc. </li>
<li>Continuing forward within your copied template, set the sheet to editable and set General Access [- Cohere FTE+CW] to Editor.</li>
<li>Click the <code>Parrot</code> button in the toolbar followed by the <code>Configure Sheets Interface</code> button to launch the Setup Dashboard.  
    
> <i>You may be asked to provide permissions to the script before being able to open the interface. Please authorize using your Cohere email and then repeat step 4 to open the Setup Dashboard.</i>
</li>
<li> The Setup Dashboard will provide input fields for your <code>Project Name</code>, <code>Deel Code</code>, and <code>Instructions Link</code>. The provided Project Name and Deel code will appear on the home page of the finalized interface and the instructions link will be connected to the <code>Instructions</code> button within tasks and on the home page.</li>
<li>Within the Setup Dashboard, a horizontal list of all columns present in the <code>data</code> will be displayed.</li>
<li> You must choose a column type from the table below for each of these columns. <ol><li>Selecting <code>Mandatory</code> will result in the interface enforcing that a value must be provided within that column before a task can be submitted.</li> <li>Selecting <code>Rated</code> indicates that the column is being used with the <code>Better</code> and <code>Worse</code> column types, <b>this is not the same as a regular 1/5 rating dropdown</b>.</li> <li>There must only be one instance of each of the following column types: <code>Annotator</code>,  <code>Row ID</code>,  <code>Task ID</code>,  <code>QA Annotator</code>, and <code>QA</code>.</li></ol></li>

<li>Click on <code>Configure</code> to submit your configuration.</li>

</ol>

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> To add columns to the data tab after configuring please use the <code>Add a new column</code> button within the Setup dashboard. Adding new columns while the interface is being used by annotators may cause issues when writing to the sheet. The best course of action to make changes to the interface setup is to inform all annotators to pause using the interface while changes are being made. Once the changes have been made and the new configuration has been submitted, all annotators using the interface should refresh their instances.
